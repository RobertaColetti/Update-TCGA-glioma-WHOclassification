Codes for reproducibility of methods in doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.19.529134.

All the contents collected in this folder are also available at: https://github.com/sysbiomed/MONET

Files are organised in two folders named “Scripts-for-reproducibility” and “Final-outputs”.

“Scripts-for-reproducibility” contains the two main scripts, "2016-classification.R" and "2021-classification.R", which can be used to reproduce the Method-2016 and Method-2021, respectively. 

"Creation_output1.R", "Creation_output2.R", and "Creation_output3.R" serve to create the 3 outputs: 
- Matrix_WHO2016.csv
- Matrix_WHO2021.csv
- SIMPLIFIED_CLASSIFICATION_TCGA_2016_2021.csv

which are recorded in “Final-outputs” folder.
